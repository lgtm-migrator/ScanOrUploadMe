# ScanOrUploadMe

This project contains the ScanOrUploadMe project created during January - March 2019 at Uppsala University. The ScanOrUploadMe mobile app enables users to digitalize their physical (e.g., wedding invite via mail) or unstructured event invitations (e.g., appointment via e-mail). The mobile app takes a picture or a screenshot as input and transforms it into a digital event.

The project is composed of two applications:

- a client-side mobile app written in React-Native (Expo Framework)
- a stateless server written in Node.JS

## Frontend: React-Native (Expo) App

The frontend code can be found in the `app` folder.

## Backend: Node.JS/Express.JS server

The backend code can be found in the `server` folder.
