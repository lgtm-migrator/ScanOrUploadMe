## Summary: Were all sprint goals met?

We initially planned to do **44 story points** but we realized that we had some redundant story points and, therefore, the current velocity is higher than expected. That's why we have also decided to delay a ticket to the next sprint. Also, one ticket has not been finished and will be continued next week. 

**Still in progress:**

- Encryption: Implementation Mobile App <-> ExpressJS Server #31 (5)

**The sprint goals which were not completed:**

- Bug: Review Debugger Errors #56 (3)

- Encryption: Implementation Mobile App <-> ExpressJS Server [Backend] #31 (5).
