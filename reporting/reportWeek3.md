## Sprint Goals for the following week (sprint 3)
38
The following issues have been selected as the targets for next weeks sprint. The issue for each ticket can be found in the project's sprint backlog column: 
39
​
40
- "write mock JSON data => local calendar event (app)"
41
- "JSON event => display 'pretty' calendar event"
42
- "process/transform data from google cloud to calendar event"
43
- "send request from server to Google Cloud NLP"
44
​
45
**Note:** We're aiming for somewhat fewer story points (20) for next week because in the past sprints the effort required to implement the chosen tickets always exceeded our expectations and we ended up spending a lot more time than intended.
