## Pull Requests
This week we have successfully created/merged the following number of pull requests. 
- Created: 5
- Merged: 5

## Summary: Were all sprint goals met?
Almost all sprint goals were met, most consisting of interacting with Google cloud, making the client server communication work, and displaying a basic event info from a JSON source.

The sprint goals which were not completed:
- None

## Sprint Goals for the following week (sprint 3)
The following issues have been selected as the targets for next weeks sprint. The issue for each ticket can be found in the project's sprint backlog column: 

- "write mock JSON data => local calendar event (app)"
- "JSON event => display 'pretty' calendar event"
- "process/transform data from google cloud to calendar event"
- "send request from server to Google Cloud NLP"

**Note:** We're aiming for somewhat fewer story points (20) for next week because in the past sprints the effort required to implement the chosen tickets always exceeded our expectations and we ended up spending a lot more time than intended.  

**Goal:** Integrating the components - functioning workflow including integrated feedback from Google Cloud Vision API displayed as a "pretty" calendar event which can be saved to the local calendar.
