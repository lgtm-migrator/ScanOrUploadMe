## Summary: Were all sprint goals met?

All sprint goals were met. We initially planned to work less during this sprint, however, we underestimated the amount of story points on some issues. Some issues in the backlog also overlapped with some issues we did during the sprint. So in the end, this sprint was worth more story points than we initially planned.

The sprint goals which were not completed:

- None
